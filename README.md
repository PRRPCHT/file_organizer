# File Organizer

A Rust-based command-line tool that automatically organizes files into folders based on their extension, modification date, and custom recipes. Perfect for organizing photos, documents, downloads, and other files into a structured folder hierarchy.

Yes, the name is very uninspired...

## Features

- üìÅ **Smart File Organization**: Automatically sorts files based on file extensions and modification dates
- üìÖ **Date-based Folder Structure**: Create year/month/day folder hierarchies using customizable date formats
- üîÑ **Flexible File Operations**: Move or copy files based on your preferences
- üìã **Recipe-based Configuration**: Define multiple organization rules in JSON recipe files
- üß™ **Dry Run Mode**: Test your organization rules before actually moving files

## Usage

### Basic Command Structure

```bash
file_organizer <RECIPES> [OPTIONS]
```

### Arguments

- `RECIPES` - **Required**: Path to the JSON file containing organization recipes

### Options

- `--dry_run` - Performs a dry run test (no files will be moved or copied)

### Examples

#### Basic Usage

```bash
# Organize files using a recipe file
file_organizer recipes/photos.json

# Test your recipe without actually moving files
file_organizer recipes/photos.json --dry_run
```

## Recipe File Structure

The recipe file is a JSON array containing one or more organization recipes. Each recipe defines how files from a source folder should be organized into a destination folder.

### Recipe Fields

| Field                | Type          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`               | String        | ‚úÖ       | Unique identifier for the recipe.                                                                                                                                         |
| `source_folder`      | String        | ‚úÖ       | Path to the folder containing files to organize.                                                                                                                          |
| `destination_folder` | String        | ‚úÖ       | Path to the folder where organized files will be placed.                                                                                                                  |
| `subfolders`         | Array[String] | ‚ùå       | Date format for each level of subfolders (e.g., "%Y" for year). If not set no folder will be created.                                                                     |
| `allowed_extensions` | Array[String] | ‚ùå       | List of file extensions to process (empty array = all extensions). If not set no folder will be created.                                                                  |
| `move_files`         | Boolean       | ‚ùå       | If true, files are moved; if false, files are copied (default: false, files are copied).                                                                                  |
| `last_run`           | String        | ‚ùå       | Date of last execution (automatically managed) that allows resuming the organization from the last execution/the date set manually. If not set, all files are considered. |

### Date Format Patterns

The tool uses the `chrono` crate's date formatting. Common patterns include:

- `%Y` - Year with century (e.g., "2024")
- `%m` - Month as zero-padded number (e.g., "01", "12")
- `%d` - Day as zero-padded number (e.g., "01", "31")
- `%Y-%m` - Year-month (e.g., "2024-01")
- `%Y-%m-%d` - Full date (e.g., "2024-01-15")
- `%Y-%m-%d - Backup` - Date with custom suffix (e.g., "2024-01-15 - Backup")

### Example Recipe File

```json
[
	{
		"name": "Photo_Organization",
		"source_folder": "/Users/user/Downloads/Photos",
		"destination_folder": "/Users/user/Pictures/Organized",
		"subfolders": ["%Y"],
		"allowed_extensions": ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "heic", "heif", "dng", "gif"],
		"move_files": false,
		"last_run": "2024-01-15"
	},
	{
		"name": "Document_Backup",
		"source_folder": "/Users/user/Documents/Inbox",
		"destination_folder": "/Users/user/Documents/Archive",
		"subfolders": ["%Y", "%m", "%d"],
		"allowed_extensions": ["pdf", "doc", "docx", "txt", "rtf"],
		"move_files": true,
		"last_run": "2024-01-15"
	},
	{
		"name": "Video_Collection",
		"source_folder": "/Volumes/External/Videos",
		"destination_folder": "/Users/user/Videos/Organized",
		"subfolders": ["%Y", "%Y-%m-%d - Videos"],
		"allowed_extensions": ["mp4", "avi", "mov", "mkv", "wmv"],
		"move_files": false,
		"last_run": "2024-01-15"
	}
]
```
